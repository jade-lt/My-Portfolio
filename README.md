# The-Cocktail-Shaker

Generates a cocktail idea and an image - if you like it, you can generate the recipe, and if not, you just click again for a new idea until you find one you like.

The idea was to keep the page content as minimal as possible, so buttons are only visible when relevant and hidden when they are no longer needed. Images also resize to better display relevant content at any given time.

Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap

The cocktails are sourced from https://www.thecocktaildb.com/
