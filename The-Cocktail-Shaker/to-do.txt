Issues still to fix
- almost fixed ingredient rendering - just need ingredients to be aligned right up against the left of their div!!!
- there is a lag with drink name and image return, but buttons show up immediately, need to add a wait function
- tried to add a bootstrap carousel, but then the images i input were huge so had to workshop image sizes

Read me
- add general info
- issues and how they were solved
    - couldn't get the js generated buttons to work, so created them in html and then used hide and show
    - the generate recipe button would actually generate an entirely new cocktail idea and then give the recipe for that
    - when generating recipe info from the api, some drinks returned ingredient values as null, so I created a for loop that excluded those and returned only ingredients that had a value, and then added those values into a new ul


Add style
- colour scheme
- background images/cartoons
