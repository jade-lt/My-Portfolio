issues to fix
- there is a lag with drink name and image return, but buttons show up immediately, need to add a wait function

Read me
- add general info
- issues and how they were solved
    - couldn't get the js generated buttons to work, so created them in html and then used hide and show
    - the generate recipe button would actually generate an entirely new cocktail idea and then give the recipe for that
    - tried to add a bootstrap carousel, but then the images i input were huge so had to workshop image sizes

Add style
- colour scheme
- background images/cartoons
Commit


Extras
- animations?
    - backgound images move
    - cocktail shaker shakes for period of time
